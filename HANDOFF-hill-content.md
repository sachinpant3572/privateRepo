# Hill country content, then tunnels and bridges (started 2026-10-31)

Sachin, 2026-10-31: "Build the content, and then the tunnels and bridges"
(after the land step; content = TODO.md hill country steps 2-4; tunnels and
bridges = #110). Design: `docs/hill_country_design_map.png`,
tools/hill_design_map.py (places, zones, lines). Land notes:
HANDOFF-hill-country.md. Rough cost from TODO: steps 2-4 ~140-260 h, #110
on top; built in phases, each committed; `/effort xhigh` suits it.

## Phases

1. **Places** (#122). Generator (main session): a `hill_places` step in
   build_country.py before `street_lots`, from a HILL_PLACES table (kind,
   x, y, id): frontage lots along the nearest way for the two villages, a
   trailer park cluster, single sites for the rest; the lab road and the
   timber haul as mountain_plan SPECS; Tallow Lake and Fernmoor Pond as
   level water with dug beds; streams as ribbons; walks in the villages so
   people spawn; mountain-zone diner/store/hunting store open as places.
   Kit (builder agent, owns scripts/kits/hill_kit.gd): research_lab,
   lab_gate, sawmill, cult_compound, ranger_post, logging_camp,
   mine_entrance, stone_ring, hot_spring, cold_spring, mountain_hotel,
   lodge_hotel, rave_clearing, bungee_platform, fairground, hunting_store.
   Reused kinds: diner, gas_station, general_store, motel, truck_stop, bar,
   house, garage, town_hall, trailer park (cluster style "trailers").
2. **Life** (#123): wildlife (deer, coyote, mountain lion, rabbit: built
   meshes, leg animation, wander/flee/attack), hunting (rifle sold with a
   licence at the hunting store, seasons, pelts), flora bands by height,
   hikers/runners/hunters on trails, a weekday calendar with small-town
   events (fair, rodeo, market, festival, speed trap) and night raves.
3. **Activities** (#124): checkpoint races and illegal night races on the
   hill loop, stunt jumps (ramp surface + airtime), cycling, parachuting,
   bungee.
4. **Tunnels and bridges** (#125, #110): a deck layer (polylines with width
   and z profile) that vehicles and people stand on when near its level;
   bridge meshes; tunnel portals, tubes, terrain cut at portals, the
   see-through view inside; then the 26 `structures`, stream crossings,
   the sky bridge, rail bridges.

## Decisions

- Hunting goes ahead (Sachin 2026-10-30 asked for licence, seasons, store,
  pelts); the older ACTIVITY_ROADMAP line "Hunting: never" is superseded.
  No weapons exist: a hunting rifle that fires only at animals, only in the
  hunting ground, keeps it from becoming a general weapons system.
- Cult: fictional beliefs, no real religious symbols or text (world bible).
- Parachuting: the summit helipad is #113 (not asked), so jumps start from
  a helicopter (#115) or a cliff BASE exit.
- Stunt ramps need a surface above the ground grid: built as the first use
  of the phase-4 deck layer, or as a ramp pad in the grid if that is enough.

## Facts

- No ground collider: vehicles and people set y = Terrain.height
  (vehicle.gd:1368, humanoid.gd:170); colliders are boxes only.
- One water plane at y -0.55; lakes at a level need their own mesh.
- No peds in the hills: population spawns on `walks`, made only in
  WALK_ZONES (build_country.py:275).
- places.gd opens diners/stores only in SUBURB_ZONES (52-54).
- Rebuild: plan_dump, then build_country, then mountain_plan / world map
  (HANDOFF-hill-country.md). RNG use changes shift lots everywhere.
